      <td><blockquote>Dozens of people are believed trapped in ruined Amatrice, Accumoli and Pescara del Tronto, in mountainous central Italy.
There have been hundreds of aftershocks since the quake struck, hampering relief efforts and damaging already unstable buildings.
More than 4,300 rescuers are using heavy machinery and their bare hands.
Rescuers have advised journalists and bystanders to leave Amatrice urgently, as "the town is crumbling", the BBC's Jenny Hill says.
Another powerful aftershock struck the town on Thursday afternoon, sending a huge dust cloud into the air.</blockquote><br>
