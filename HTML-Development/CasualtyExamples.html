      <td><blockquote>"Dozens of people are believed trapped in ruined Amatrice, Accumoli and Pescara del Tronto, in mountainous central Italy.
There have been hundreds of aftershocks since the quake struck, hampering relief efforts and damaging already unstable buildings.
More than 4,300 rescuers are using heavy machinery and their bare hands.
Rescuers have advised journalists and bystanders to leave Amatrice urgently, as "the town is crumbling", the BBC's Jenny Hill says.
Another powerful aftershock struck the town on Thursday afternoon, sending a huge dust cloud into the air."<br>

      <td><blockquote>"On March 11, 2011, at 2:46 p.m. local time, a magnitude-9.0 earthquake ruptured a 500-kilometer-long fault zone off the northeast 
        coast of Japan. Its epicenter was 130 kilometers off Sendai, Honshu; it occurred at a relatively shallow depth of 32 kilometers. The temblor violently shook northeast 
        Honshu for six minutes, and collapsed its coastline by one meter. The thrusting moved Honshu about 2.4 meters eastward, and the seismic waves on the Pacific Ocean floor set 
        off tsunami waves traveling at the speed of a jet plane (about 700 kilometers per hour). Waves 3 to 38 meters tall pounded Honshu’s coastline, destroying towns and villages and 
        flooding areas up to 10 kilometers inland. "<br>
