      <td><blockquote>"Dozens of people are believed trapped in ruined Amatrice, Accumoli and Pescara del Tronto, in mountainous central Italy.
There have been hundreds of aftershocks since the quake struck, hampering relief efforts and damaging already unstable buildings.
More than 4,300 rescuers are using heavy machinery and their bare hands.
Rescuers have advised journalists and bystanders to leave Amatrice urgently, as "the town is crumbling", the BBC's Jenny Hill says.
Another powerful aftershock struck the town on Thursday afternoon, sending a huge dust cloud into the air."<br>

        coast of Japan. Its epicenter was 130 kilometers off Sendai, Honshu; it occurred at a relatively shallow depth of 32 kilometers. The temblor violently shook northeast 
        Honshu for six minutes, and collapsed its coastline by one meter. The thrusting moved Honshu about 2.4 meters eastward, and the seismic waves on the Pacific Ocean floor set 
        off tsunami waves traveling at the speed of a jet plane (about 700 kilometers per hour). Waves 3 to 38 meters tall pounded Honshu’s coastline, destroying towns and villages and 
        flooding areas up to 10 kilometers inland. "<br>

      <td><blockquote>A major earthquake has hit Afghanistan, northern Pakistan and parts of India, with more than 150 killed and early reports suggesting it has caused extensive damage in mountainous areas.
The magnitude 7.5 quake was centred in the province of Badakhshan in the Hindu Kush mountain range in Afghanistan’s far north, and occurred at a depth of 130 miles (210km). Officials said at least 147 people were known to have been killed in Pakistan and 33 in Afghanistan.
Twelve students were killed while trying to escape from a girls’ school in Taloqan, north-east Afghanistan, and six people died in the eastern province of Nangarhar. A police official in Badakhshan said dozens of houses were destroyed in two remote and sparsely populated rural districts, with some damage reported in Fayzabad.<br>
