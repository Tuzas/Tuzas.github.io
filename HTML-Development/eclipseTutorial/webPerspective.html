    Utilizing Web Perspective In Eclipse

          <p>
          First we start by changing our perspective to web view. If you are using eclipse configured for web applications, <br>
          this will be the default view. However, if eclipse is also being used for other languages then this will need to <br>
          be configured before you can begin working. Simply click on the "open perspective" tab.   
          </p>

        <td align="right">
        <img src="https://Tuzas.github.io/HTML-Development/pictures/eclipse2.jpg" style="width:60%;height:60%;">
        </td>
      </tr>
        <td align="center">
          <p>
          Select the web perspective to change the layout of your IDE. 
          </p>

        </td>
      <tr>
        <td align="center">
        Through this perspective you can keep track of your elements, as well as seeing the child-parent relationships <br>
        Elements will be created in the sidebar view in real time, making working with hierarchies easier. In the <br>
        example we can see how the p element is a child of the body parent element.
