    <h1>Eclipse Starter Tutorial</h1>
    <ol class="main">
      <li>
        <h2>
        Creating A New Project
        </h2> <br>

         <br>
        Start out by creating a new web project by selecting "file", then "new", then "static web project". <br>
        This will create a new project for you to create your HTML and other file types in. 
      </li> <br>
      <li>
        <h2>
        Naming Your Project
        </h2> <br>

        <br>
        Name your project in the "Project Name" text field. Make sure to be clear in any names you use.<br>
        In this tutorial, I have named my project "Example". Click "Finish" to generate the project.
      </li> <br>
      <li>
        <h2>
        Creating An HTML File
        </h2> <br>
        <img src="https://Tuzas.github.io/HTML-Development/pictures/eclipse6.jpg" >
        <br>
        Right Click on your project and then select "New", followed by "HTML File". This will open up another window <br>
        prompting you to name your file. Make sure you name your files accurately, this helps to organize them. <br>   
      </li> <br>
      
      <li>
      <h2>
        Naming Your HTML File
        </h2> <br>
        <img src="https://Tuzas.github.io/HTML-Development/pictures/eclipse7.jpg" >
        <br>
        Name your HTML file here, clicking on finish after you are done doing so. <br>
       
      </li> <br>
      
      <li>
      <h2>
        Created HTML File
        </h2> <br>
        <img src="https://Tuzas.github.io/HTML-Development/pictures/eclipse8.jpg" >
        <br>
        If everything was done correctly, your file should be displayed in the middle window, ready for work. <br>
        Next, lets create a CSS File for our example project.
      </li> <br>
      
      <li>
      <h2>
        Naming Your CSS File
        </h2> <br>
        <img src="https://Tuzas.github.io/HTML-Development/pictures/eclipse9.jpg" >
        <br>
        We start out the same way as creating an HTML File, by going to the file menu and selecting "new".<br>
      </li> <br>
      
      <li>
      <h2>
        Working With Different Files
        </h2> <br>
        <img src="https://Tuzas.github.io/HTML-Development/pictures/eclipse10.jpg" >
        <br>
        Here, as with the HTML file, we name our CSS file.<br>
      </li> <br>
      
      <li>
      <h2>
        Creating a CSS File
        </h2> <br>
        <img src="https://Tuzas.github.io/HTML-Development/pictures/eclipse11.jpg" >
        <br>
        As a result we have two files. We can switch between working on one or the other either by<br>
        clicking on the file names on the left side of the screen or on the tabs at the top of the screen.<br>
      </li> <br>
      
    </ol>
